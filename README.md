# Identifying_Financial_Market_Risk_Matrics
This project develops custom volatility metrics to assess the risk of returns in financial markets, focusing on the S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 indices. By comparing traditional and advanced risk metrics, it provides insights for better risk management in large-cap and small-cap investments.
